# element-resize-detector
Super-optimized cross-browser resize listener for elements.

```npm install element-resize-detector```

### Include script
Include the script in the browser:
```html
<!DOCTYPE hml>
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <script src="node_modules/element-resize-detector/dist/element-resize-detector.min.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
This will create a global function ```elementResieDetectorMaker```, which is the maker function that makes an element resize detector instance.

You can also ```require``` it like so:
```js
var elementResizeDetectorMaker = require("element-resize-detector");
```

### Create instance
```js
//With default options (will use the object-based approach).
var erdDefault = elementResizeDetectorMaker();

//With the experimental super fast scroll-based approach.
var erdUltraFast = elementResizeDetectorMaker({
    strategy: "scroll" //<- For ultra performance. 
});
```

### API

#### listenTo(element, listener)
Listens to the element for resize events and calls the listener function with the element as argument on resize events.

**Example usage:**
```js
erd.listenTo(document.getElementById("test"), function(element) {
  //Should probably use jQuery for the width and height for compability.
  var width = element.offsetWidth;
  var height = element.offsetHeight;
  console.log("Size: " + width + "x" + height);
});
```

#### removeListener(element, listener)

#### removeAllListeners(element)
Removes all listeners from the element, but does not completely remove the detector. Use this function if you may add listeners later and don't want the detector to have to initialize again.

#### uninstall(element)
Completely removes the detector and all listeners.

**Caveats:**

1. If the element has ```display: static``` it will be changed to ```display: relative```. This means if you have unintentional ```top/right/bottom/left``` styles on the element (which was ignored when being ```static```) they will now be applied to the element. This will also mean that if there are any elements with ```position: absolute``` as children to the element, they will now be positioned relative to the element.
2. An ```<object>``` element will be injected as a direct child to the element. It has ```position: absolute``` so it will not affect the page flow. It is also visibly hidden.

### Credits
This library is using the two approaches (scroll and object) as first described at [http://www.backalleycoder.com/2013/03/18/cross-browser-event-based-element-resize-detection/](http://www.backalleycoder.com/2013/03/18/cross-browser-event-based-element-resize-detection/).

The scroll based approach implementation was based on Marc J's implementation [https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries/blob/master/src/ResizeSensor.js](https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries/blob/master/src/ResizeSensor.js).

Please note that both approaches have been heavily reworked for better performance and robustness.
